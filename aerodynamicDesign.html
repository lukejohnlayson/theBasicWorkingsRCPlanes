					<h2>Welcome to this Webpage</h2>
					<p>This page will inform you on the aerodynamic design of airplanes and how they fly</p>
				</div>
                <p class="intro">
				The design of a remote control plane is the most important aspect of the aircraft. Remote control planes largely resemble larger aircraft with some designed as scale models. They fly using the same physics which will be briefly described below.
                </p>
				<img class="brand" src="resources/wingDiagram.jpg">
				<p class="intro">
				There are 4 forces that act on aircraft. They are thrust (forwards), drag (backwards), lift (upwards), and weight (downwards). Thrust is achieved by the motors, drag is the air resistance acting on the plane, weight is the weight of the plane pulling it down to earth. Lift is where it gets more complicated. There are different ways to generate lift, but it is pretty much creating upwards thrust through the means of wings, rockets, or large turboprops. Naturally remote control planes use wings. The diagram shows the design of a wing and how it generates upwards thrust.

                    Remote control planes need certain electrical components to be able to propel themselves and be remotely controlled by transmitters. This page will describe the main purpose of all the different bit and pieces.

                    <h4>Transmitter</h4>
                    <p>The transmitter is the main interface that is used while flying. It binds to the receiver and sends your input to it. You move the control sticks to direct the aircraft while several other buttons and switches can be programmed for various other things, such as retractable landing gear, autonomous flight, camera, etc. They support a certain number of channels from 4CH+. The more channels your transmitter (and receiver) supports the more components can be connected to your receiver. They are often referred to as a remote control and come in many brands however the most reputable is Spektrum.</p>

                    <h4>Reciever</h4>
                    <p>The receiver is the component that controls and powers all the components on board the aircraft, such as the servos, motors, and esc. It binds directly with the transmitter and often contains a gyroscope to stabilize the aircraft and counters wind gusts and propeller movement. It has several plugs depending on the number of channels it supports. It will also connect to the battery with a separate plug. The battery does not take up any channels.</p>

                <div class="ESC">
                    <h4>Electrical Speed Controller</h4>
                    <p>The electrical speed controller regulates the speed of an electrical motor. There are generally two types of ESC’s when it come to remote control aircraft. Brushed DC ESC and brushless DC ESC. Brushed ESC’s are mostly simple, control the voltage and amperage to control the speed of the motor. However, the most common are brushless ESC’s due to brushless motors being lighter, power efficient and long-life span. Brushless ESC’s are far more complicated though. The correct phase varies with the motor rotation, which is to be considered by the ESC: Usually, back EMF from the motor is used to detect this rotation, but variations exist that use magnetic (Hall effect) or optical detectors. Computer-programmable speed controls generally have user-specified options which allow setting low voltage cut-off limits, timing, acceleration, braking and direction of rotation. Reversing the motor's direction may also be accomplished by switching any two of the three leads from the ESC to the motor.</p>
